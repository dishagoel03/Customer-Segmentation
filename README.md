# Customer-Segmentation
Welcome to our Customer Segmentation Analysis project! This initiative is dedicated to uncovering valuable insights into customer behavior by employing cutting-edge data analysis and machine learning techniques. The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Data Preprocessing and Feature Selection: We meticulously preprocess the dataset, carefully selecting and curating relevant features essential for our analysis.

Clustering Algorithms for Segmentation: Leveraging a range of clustering algorithms, we categorize customers into distinct segments based on their app preferences and behaviors.
